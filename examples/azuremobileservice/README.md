### Azure Mobile Service Example

this example shows how you can use the token client to store the tokens in a table on a mobile service instance. This has the main advantage that people only have to authorize once and can connect and use the api with multiple devices. Setting up notifications and webhooks becomes easier as well.

### Prerequisites
Registered Visual Studio Online Application
Azure Account
Azure Mobile Service with a table created to store the tokens.
